This project builds interpretable machine learning models to predict credit risk using the German Credit dataset. It compares logistic regression and decision tree models in terms of performance and explainability, and applies SHAP and LIME techniques to visualize and interpret how input features influence predictions. The goal is to support transparent, reliable decision-making in loan approval processes.
